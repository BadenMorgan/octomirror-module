# Octomirror Module
This is a module for a Magic Mirror device that will interact with an Octoprint Instance. 

The module will allow you to:
- View a live feed of the raspicam stream
- Start and stop prints
- View G-Code viewer
- Manually control the printer

If you have any suggest, please let me know [by an issue](https://github.com/DongerZonie/octomirror-module/issues/new).
